## Makefile Command 💻

This project is equipped with Makefile command to shorten command writing, to see available command please refer to [Makefile][makefile_link].
Please change the Environment Variable such as: `${FIREBASE_EMAIL}`, etc., in the file to your need.

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh

## Working with Translations 🌐

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:template/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
 <array>
  <string>en</string>
  <string>id</string>
 </array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```tree
├── l10n
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_en.arb
│   │   └── app_id.arb
```

Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_id.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "id",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Penghitung",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Teks yang tampil pada AppBar di Halaman Counter"
    }
}
```

## Migration Guide

This section provides an overview of the breaking changes and steps needed to migrate from the previous version of this template to the latest release.

### Migration to Flutter 3.41.6 (Latest)

#### 1. Flutter Version & Tooling

- `.fvmrc` is now pinned to **3.41.6**. Update your local Flutter SDK or run `fvm use` if using [FVM](https://fvm.app/).
- Dart SDK constraint updated to `>=3.11.0 <4.0.0`.

#### 2. iOS: CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager

- The `Podfile` has been removed. iOS dependencies are now managed via **Swift Package Manager** (SwiftPM), which is the default in Flutter 3.24+.
- The `ios/` project has been regenerated with a clean SwiftPM integration.
- The app now uses the **UIScene lifecycle** with a `SceneDelegate.swift` (Flutter 3.41.6 default).
- If you have custom CocoaPods plugins, you may need to check their SwiftPM compatibility.

#### 3. Android Gradle Updates

- **Gradle**: 8.3 → 8.14
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.2.1 → 8.11.1
- **Kotlin**: 1.9.20 → 2.2.20 (K2 compiler)
- `android.enableJetifier` removed (deprecated).
- `kotlin-stdlib` and `multidex` dependencies removed (auto-included / unnecessary with minSdk 21+).
- JVM args updated for better build performance.

#### 4. Localization Changes

- The `flutter_gen` synthetic package has been deprecated. Localization files are now generated to `lib/l10n/generated/`.
- Update imports from `package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart` to `package:template/l10n/generated/app_localizations.dart`.

#### 5. Dependency Changes

- `injectable` updated to `^2.7.1` and `injectable_generator` to `^2.9.0`.
- `google_fonts` updated to `^6.2.2` (Dart 3.11 compatibility fix).
- `flutter_native_splash` removed from runtime dependencies (only needed as a CLI tool for generating splash assets, not at runtime).
- `dependency_overrides` for `collection`, `intl`, and `meta` removed (no longer needed).

#### 6. Post-Migration Checks

```sh
# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Generate localization files
flutter gen-l10n

# Generate injectable and other code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Verify
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --flavor development --debug -t lib/main_development.dart
flutter build ios --flavor development --no-codesign --debug -t lib/main_development.dart
```

### Previous Migration (Freezed Removal)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Removal of Freezed Code Generation

- All Freezed code-generation files have been removed in favor of manually defined sealed classes.
- `Failure` now has `localFailure` and `serverFailure`.
- `ValueFailure` includes `empty`, `multiLine`, `notInRange`, and `invalidUniqueId`.
- `FlashState` refactored from Freezed to a sealed class. Replace `.when`/`.maybeWhen` with `switch/case`.
- Update test imports to use the new sealed class files.

</details>
